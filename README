The original LunarLander in "Hello World! Computer Programming
for Kids and Other Beginners"
was a very simple 1-D (y-axis, vertical motion only)
version of Lunar Lander, just to demonstrate a simple
gravity simulaiton using Pygame.

PyLander adds the x-axis (sideways motion).
You can now rotate the lander using
the right/left arrow keys, more like
the original arcade version.
It also changes the thrust control from a
mouse-based (dragging the slider) to key-based
(press/hold the spacebar).

Instead of the moonsurface image,
it uses a simple landing pad rectangle.

This software is based on the LunarLander sample program
from the book Hello World! Computer Programming for Kids
and Other Beginners.  That software is (c) Warren Sande, 2009.  It
